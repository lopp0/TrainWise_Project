## Auth & Accounts
1. Welcome / landing screen — first entry point for guests
2. Login — email + password sign‑in (`POST /api/auth/login`, validated by `sp_LoginUser`)

## Planned / Not yet implemented

Empty placeholders for future work — present in comparable projects, **not** built in TrainWise today:

- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions build + test on PRs, gated deploy on merge (today: manual publish from VS 2022)
- **Secret scanning** — `gitleaks` pre‑commit hook + CI scan (today: manual safe‑push checklist)
- **Static analysis** — CodeQL + `npm audit` / `dotnet list package --vulnerable` gates
- **Cloud ML** — deploy the Python service to Azure so the coach forecast works without the PC
- **iOS app** — the Expo iOS shell is unmaintained (Android only)
- **Hardened auth** — salted password hashing + token‑based sessions + rate limiting
- **Content‑safety moderation** — screening of user‑generated text / images
- **Web / PWA client** — TrainWise is native‑only
- **Persistent AI chat history** — currently in‑memory per screen visit
